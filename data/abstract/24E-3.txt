Plato provides fast approximate analytics on time series, by precomputing and storing compressed time series. Plato’s key novelty is the delivery of tight deterministic error guarantees for the linear algebra operators over vectors/time series, the inner product operator and arithmetic operators. Com-posing them allows for evaluating common statistics, such as correlation and cross-correlation. In the offline process-ing phase, Plato (i) segments each time series into several dis-joint segmentations using known fixed-length or variable-length segmentation algorithms; (ii) compresses each segment by a compression function that is coming from a user-chosen compression function family; and (iii) associates to each segment 1 to 3 precomputed error measures, which are used during query processing to compute the error guarantees.Importantly, we identify certain compression function families that lead to theoretically and experimentally higher quality guarantees.
