With  advances in internet of things (IoT), several database technologies (e.g., time series DBs, document stores, cluster computing frameworks, etc.)  have begun to advertise themselves as  systems  specially suited  for managing IoT data. A few IoT database benchmarks have  been developed to compare   systems, but the benchmarks primarily   focus on support for fast sensor data ingestion.  Such benchmarks ignore  complex queries that are beginning to be part of real-world IoT deployments, specially those that deal with semantically meaningful interpretation of raw sensory data. We propose  BuildingBench, a benchmark focusing on complex analytics queries over IoT data.  BuidingBench,  derived from a deployed smart building monitoring system, comprises of: 1) an extensible data model that captures the fundamentals of IoT smart space, 2) a set of representative queries focusing on analytical tasks, and 3) a data generation tool that generates large amounts of synthetic sensor and semantic data based on seed data collected from a real system. We present an evaluation of seven diverse and representative database systems and highlight some interesting findings that can be considered when deciding what database technologies to use under different types of query workloads.
