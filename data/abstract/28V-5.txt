Crowdsourcing is a new computing paradigm where humans are actively involved in the procedure of computing, especially for tasks that are intrinsically easier for humans than for computers. Spatiotemporal crowdsourcing (SC) is an increasing popular category of crowdsourcing in the era of mobile internet and sharing economy, where spatiotemporal data plays a central role. In fact, spatiotemporal crowdsourcing has stimulated a series of recent industrial successes including sharing economy based urban services (Uber and Gigwalk) and spatiotemporal data collection (OpenStreetMap and Waze).

This survey dives deep into the challenges and techniques brought by the unique characteristics of spatiotemporal crowdsourcing. Particularly, we identify four core algorithmic issues in spatiotemporal crowdsourcing: (1) task assignment, (2) quality control, (3) incentive mechanism design and (4) privacy protection. We conduct a comprehensive and systematic review of existing research on the aforementioned four issues. We also analyze representative spatiotemporal crowdsourcing applications and explain how they are enabled by these four technical issues. Finally, we discuss open questions that need to be addressed for future spatiotemporal crowdsourcing research and applications.
