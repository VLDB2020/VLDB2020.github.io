ML infrastructure such as TensorFlow and PyTorch has been a strong center for research and engineering innovations over the past few years. These software systems share a number of common elements with SQL query engines, such as a declarative programming abstraction, a set of operators with rich algebraic properties, and a concurrent / distributed dataflow execution engine. At the same time, ML infra requirements feature a number of significant departures from relational / structure data processing, where the former often place a larger focus on supporting richer data types (e.g. texts, audio and video, additional to tabular data), involve different access patterns (e.g. repeated, shuffled scans over training data) and call for a more complex programming model (e.g. backprop support via Automatic Differentiation).

In this talk, we will cover a set of research and engineering problems in building ML infra, which we believe could benefit from the database communityâ€™s insights and contributions.
