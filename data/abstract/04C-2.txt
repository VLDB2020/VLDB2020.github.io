We study the problem of augmenting relational tuples with inconsistency awareness and tackling top-k queries under a set of denial constraints (DCs). We define a notion of inconsistent tuples with respect to a set of DCs and define two measures of inconsistency degrees, which consider single and multiple  violations of  constraints. In order to compute these measures, we leverage two models of provenance, namely why-provenance and provenance polynomials. We investigate top-k  queries that allow to rank the answer tuples by their inconsistency degrees. Since one of our measure is monotonic and the other  non-monotonic, we design an integrated  top-k algorithm  to compute the top k results of a query w.r.t.
both  inconsistency measures. The algorithm uses linear space in the size of the database  and, as a side contribution, we prove   its optimality, which is a result of its own. By means of an extensive experimental study, we gauge the effectiveness of inconsistency-aware query answering and the efficiency of our algorithm with respect to a baseline, where query results are fully computed  and  ranked afterwards. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work aiming at quantifying the degree of inconsistency of relational tuples and a viable tractable alternative to consistent query answering.
