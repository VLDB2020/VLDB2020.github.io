Given a database with numeric attributes, it is often of interest to rank the tuples in the database according to linear scoring functions. For any scoring function and any subset of tuples, the regret of a subset is defined as the (relative) difference in scores between the top-1 tuple of the subset and the top-1 tuple of the entire database. Finding the regret-ratio minimizing set (RRMS), i.e., the subset of a required size k that minimizes the maximum regret-ratio across all possible ranking functions, has been a well-studied problem in recent years. It is known to be NP-complete, and there are several approximation algorithms for it. Other NP-complete variants have also been investigated, e.g., finding the set of size k that minimizes the average regret ratio over all linear functions. 

In this paper we take a different path towards tackling these problems. We propose a unified algorithm that is designed to solve these problems, which is in contrast to the prior works that have designed customized algorithms for each problem, that are unlikely to easily generalize to other variants. In our case, our customization is localized to the design of variant-specific subroutines or ``oracles'' that are called by the unified algorithm. Secondly, our unified algorithm takes inspiration from the seemingly unrelated problem of clustering from data mining, and the corresponding \kmedoid algorithm. We make several innovative technical contributions in designing our approach, including the use of various techniques such as linear programming, edge sampling in graphs, volume estimation of multi-dimensional convex polytopes, and several other techniques. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis of our proposed approach, as well as provide substantial experimental results over real and synthetic data sets to demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach.
