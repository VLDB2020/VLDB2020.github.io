The IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator (IDAA) is a state-of-the art hybrid database system that seamlessly extends the strong transactional capabilities of Db2 for z/OS with the very fast column-store processing in Db2 Warehouse. The Accelerator maintains a copy of the data from Db2 for z/OS in its backend database. Data can be synchronized at a single point in time with a granularity of a table, one or more of its partitions, or incrementally as rows changed using replication technology.
The replication technology that has been employed since IDAA version 3 is IBM Change Data Capture (CDC). Version 7.5.0 introduces a superior replication technology as a replacement for IDAA’s use of CDC – Integrated Synchronization. In this paper, we present how Integrated Synchronization is capable of delivering performance improved by factors to pave the way for near real-time Hybrid Transactional and Analytical (HTAP) processing.
