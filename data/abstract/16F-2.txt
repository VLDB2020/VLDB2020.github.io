Systems continue to grow in complexity in response to the need to
support vast quantities of data and a wide variety of workloads.
Small changes in workloads and system configuration can result in
significantly different system behaviour and performance
characteristics. As a result, system administrators and developers
spend many hours diagnosing and debugging performance problems in
data systems and the applications that use them. In this paper, we
present Sentinel, an analysis tool that assists these users by
constructing fine-grained models of system behaviour and comparing
them to pinpoint differences in system behaviour for different
workloads and system configurations. Importantly, Sentinel's
insights are derived from built-in debug logging libraries without
necessitating that their log messages be written to disk, thereby
generalizing to all systems that use debug logging without incurring
its overheads.  Our experiments demonstrate Sentinel's superiority
in analyzing the execution behaviour and performance characteristics
of database systems, client applications, and web servers compared
to prior approaches.
