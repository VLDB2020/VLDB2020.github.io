We introduce Kensho, a tool for generating mapping rules between two Knowledge Bases (KBs). To create the mapping rules, Kensho starts with a set of correspondences and enriches them with additional semantic information automatically identified from the structure and constraints of the KBs. Our approach works in two phases. In the first phase, semantic associations between resources of each KB are captured. In the second phase, mapping rules are generated by interpreting the correspondences in a way that respects the discovered semantic associations among elements of each KB. Kensho's mapping rules are expressed using SPARQL queries and can be used directly to exchange knowledge from source to target.
Kensho is able to automatically rank the generated mapping rules using a set of heuristics. We present an experimental evaluation of Kensho and assess our mapping generation and ranking strategies using more than 50 synthesized and real world settings, 
chosen to showcase some of the most important applications of knowledge translation. In addition, we use three existing benchmarks to demonstrate Kensho's ability to deal with different mapping scenarios.
