Sato: Detecting the semantic types of data columns in relational tables is useful for myriad data preparation and information retrieval tasks such as data cleaning, schema matching, data discovery, and semantic search. We introduce Sato, a new learned model to automatically detect the semantic types of columns in tables, exploiting the signals from the context as well as the column values. Sato combines a deep learning model trained on a large-scale table corpus with topic modeling and structured prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art by a large margin.

Ditto: We present Ditto, a novel entity matching (EM) system based on pre-trained language models. Ditto fine-tunes the language models and casts EM as a sequence-pair classification problem with a simple architecture. With optimizations such as injecting domain knowledge and data augmentation, Ditto achieves new state-of-the-art matching accuracies while being 2X more label-efficient than existing EM solutions.
