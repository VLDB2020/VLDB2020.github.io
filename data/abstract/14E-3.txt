Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high-dimensional spaces is inherently computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. As a well-known solution to approximate NN search, LSH is able to answer the c-ANN query in sublinear time with a constant probability. The existing LSH methods focus mainly on building hash buckets based indexing such that the candidate points can be retrieved quickly. However, the proposed coarse-grained structures fail to offer accurate distance estimation for candidate points, which translates into additional computation overhead when having to examine unnecessary points. This in turn limits the performance of query processing. In contrast, we propose a fast and accurate LSH framework, called PM-LSH, to compute the c-ANN query on large scale, high-dimensional datasets. First, we adopt a simple yet effective PM-tree to index the data points. Second, we develop a tunable confidence interval to achieve accurate distance estimation and guarantee high result quality. Third, we propose an efficient algorithm on top of the PM-tree to improve the performance of computing c-ANN query. Extensive experiments with real-world data offer evidence that the proposed PM-LSH excels over existing proposals with respect to both efficiency and accuracy.
