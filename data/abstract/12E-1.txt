Strings are prevalent in real-world data sets. They often occupy a large fraction of the data and are slow to process. In this work, we present Fast Static Symbol Table (FSST), a lightweight compression scheme for strings. On text data, FSST offers decompression and compression speed similar to or better than existing speed-optimized methods such as LZ4, yet significantly better compression factors. Moreover, its use of a static symbol table allows random access to individual, compressed strings, enabling lazy decompression and query processing on compressed data. We believe these features will make FSST a valuable piece in the standard compression toolbox.
