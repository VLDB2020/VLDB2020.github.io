Due to the falling costs of data acquisition and storage, research and
industrial groups are interested in accurately finding all instances of rare
events in large datasets.
For instance, scientists can cheaply capture thousands of hours of video, but
are limited by the need to manually inspect all the video to identify
relevant objects and events.
To reduce this cost, recent work proposes to use cheap proxy models, such as
image classifiers, to identify an approximate set of data points satisfying a
data selection filter.
Unfortunately, this recent work does not provide the statistical accuracy
guarantees necessary in scientific and production settings that have strong
accuracy requirements.

In this work, we introduce novel algorithms for approximate selection queries
with statistical accuracy guarantees.
Namely, given a limited number of exact data inspections from an oracle, often a
human or an expensive machine learning model, our algorithms meet a minimum
precision or recall target with high probability.
In contrast, existing approaches can catastrophically fail in satisfying these
recall and precision targets.
We show that our algorithms can improve query result quality by up to 30x
for both the precision and recall targets in both real and synthetic datasets.
