Data Management R&D at NEC: Database Engages with Multimedia for Video Analysis In this talk, Dr. Liu will give an overview of the research topics that are currently conducted at the Biometrics Research Laboratories of NEC Corporation, such as processing and analysis on multimedia big data. The talk will mainly focus on how NEC was/is engaging the techniques of database and multimedia for large-scale video surveillance in the past, present, and future, based on the related researches conducted in NEC. A series of our work published at MM’14, SIGGRAPH’16, MM’16, MM’17, SIGMOD’17, ICMR’18, MIPR’19, CBMI’19, BigMM’19, and MM’19, WACV’20, MM’20 will be highlighted with interesting insights. Finally, Dr. Liu will pick up some challenging issues and share some future directions of video analysis for surveillance, and the key applications of surveillance video search. Such directions would be helpful to guide the research of multimedia big data in the near future.

Data Management R&D at NEC: How our service discovers insights from heterogeneous data At NEC Corporation, our knowledge-based learning research team is developing a novel DataOps service that discovers insights from heterogeneous data in DataLakes without any pains. In this talk, we introduce our product and briefly introduce recently published research, such as semantic understanding of tabular data (AAAI’19) and entity-attribute prediction on heterogeneous networks (ICDM’17). We also introduce exciting career opportunities at NEC Corporation by showing how researchers develop a new business at our companies.
