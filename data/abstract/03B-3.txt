Blockchains are distributed secure ledgers to which transactions are issued continuously and each block of transactions is tightly coupled to its predecessors.
Permissioned  blockchains place special emphasis on transactions throughput.
In this paper we present FireLedger, which leverages the iterative nature of blockchains in order to improve their throughput in optimistic execution scenarios.
FireLedger trades latency for throughput in the sense that in FireLedger the last f + 1 blocks of each node's blockchain are considered tentative, i.e., they may be rescinded in case one of the last f + 1 blocks proposers was Byzantine. 
Yet, when optimistic assumptions are met, a new block is decided in each communication step, which consists of a proposer that sends only its proposal and all other participants are sending a single bit each. 
In our performance study FireLedger obtained 20%--600% better throughput than state of the art protocols like HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt, depending on the configuration.
