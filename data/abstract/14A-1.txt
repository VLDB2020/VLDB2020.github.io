The typical approach for learned DBMS components is to capture the behavior by running a representative set of queries and use the observations to train a machine learning model. This workload-driven approach, however, has two major downsides. First, collecting the training data can be very expensive, since all queries need to be executed on potentially large databases. Second, training data has to be recollected when the workload or the database changes.
To overcome these limitations, we take a different route and propose a new data-driven approach for learned DBMS components which directly supports changes of the workload and data without the need of retraining. Indeed, one may now expect that this comes at a price of lower accuracy since workload-driven approaches can make use of more information. However, this is not the case. The results of our empirical evaluation demonstrate that our data-driven approach not only provides better accuracy than state-of-the-art learned components but also generalizes better to unseen queries.
