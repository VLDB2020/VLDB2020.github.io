### Abstract

This talk will have two parts. The first part, on “out-of-order execution” algorithms, is a long-term vision that has become reality, and the second part on COVID-19 information, is the current reality that may lead to future advances. 
First, I will talk about “out-of-order execution” algorithms that we have been working on for more than 10 years. The idea was so simple, but it took years to understand the essence of the out-of-order execution principle. We have verified significant speedups for a variety of queries and datasets over disk-based and flash-based database systems. A practical application enabled by the out-of-order execution is a healthcare data platform supporting interactive analytics on country-scale insurance claims (approximately two hundred billion records) in Japan. The out-of-order execution reduced the typical query response time from many days to a few minutes, enabling active and productive use by medical and public administration researchers to improve treatments based on the outcomes from real data of entire country. 
Second , I will describe some of our recent research advances for obtaining and managing COVID-19 information in several urgently useful application areas.
