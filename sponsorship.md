    <strong>Due to COVID-19, the VLDB Conference 2020 will be held as an online virtual conference. The meeting schedule remains unchanged from August 31st to September 4th, 2020.</strong> We refer to companies and organizations supporting VLDB 2020 through sponsorships as “sponsors.” There are four sponsor categories, Diamond, Platinum, Gold, and Silver. See <a class="no-barba" href="assets/files/sponsorship_brochure.pdf">VLDB 2020 Sponsorship Prospectus</a> for details of benefits for basic sponsors.
