# VLDB2020 Conference Time Zone Conversion Chart

The safety and well-being of our community is our top concern. The VLDB Conference 2020 will not be taking place in Tokyo in August/September. The VLDB Endowment and the organizing committee of VLDB 2020 are continuously monitoring the global Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic and will decide on the format and time of the conference in due course.
