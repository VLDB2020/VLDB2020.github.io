# VLDB2020: Registration Support

Due to the effect of Covid-19, VLDB 2020 conference will be held online. Instead of travel grants, we are very happy to announce registration support opportunities for students and faculty to present their papers in VLDB 2020. The grants provide financial support to students and faculty affiliated with universities with limited funding opportunities. Awards have a strong focus on universities in developing countries to present papers in the VLDB 2020 conference hold in Tokyo, Japan, August 31 – September 4, 2020. 

The long-term goal of the program is to encourage talented young scientists to pursue a career in database research. We have two types of support this year: 1) The VLDB Registration Support Program provides grants funded by the VLDB Endowment SPEND Committee. These will allow free registration, either 30K JPY for conference paper or 10K JPY for workshop paper. 2) The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports registration for US-based students (enrolled in a US university). The support will be similar in nature to the SPEND Committee grants. Please note that successful applicants of the NSF-funded support will be required to deliver a short written report after the conference.

## Eligibility and Selection Criteria

### For VLDB SPEND Committee grants:

Applicants must be full-time students in good standing (graduate or undergraduate), or postdoctoral fellows/researchers, or faculty members who have a paper at the conference (or associated events).

### For NSF-funded registration support:

Applicants must be US full-time students in good standing (graduate or undergraduate) who have a paper at the conference (or associated events).

Preference will be given to applicants who demonstrate keen interest in database research and are from regions that are under-represented in the database community; presenting a paper accepted at the main conference or the workshops in VLDB 2020 is mandatory.

## Application Process

Applicants should fill in the form at https://forms.gle/TRcsQgsX5SZiuwSt7 by 5 August 2020. Should you have any problems with opening the links or filling in the forms, please contact us via bin.cui @ pku.edu.cn. Selected candidates will be informed by 15 August 2020. Persons applying for the VLDB Registration support are advised to not register before hearing from us.
Please note: Applications of US students will be automatically assessed also for the NSF-funded registration grant. US-students do not need to follow a separate application process.
